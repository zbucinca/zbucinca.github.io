Hi there! I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft. Starting Fall 2026, I will join MIT as an Assistant Professor with a shared appointment in Sloan and EECS. I will be recruiting 1-2 PhD students in this upcoming cycle through MIT EECS! 

I recently completed my PhD at Harvard, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Krzysztof Gajos](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/) and to collaborate closely with Professor [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/).

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of HCI and Responsible AI. I design human-AI interaction techniques that complement people and amplify their values in AI-assisted work. To achieve this, I focus on (1) understanding how people make AI-assisted decisions and (2) designing novel interaction paradigms, explanations, and systems that optimize both task-centric outcomes, such as accuracy and efficiency, and human-centric outcomes, such as enhancing human skills and agency in AI-assisted tasks.

Over the course of my PhD, I spent two wonderful summers interning at Microsoft Research, where I was hosted by Dr. [Saleema Amershi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T0qnS1oAAAAJ&hl=en) & Dr. [Alexandra Olteanu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8IjN_vgAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2021 and Dr. [Jennifer Wortman Vaughan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YRPveMcAAAAJ&hl=en) & Dr. [Alexandra Chouldechova](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uoDW9hkAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2022.

My PhD research has been supported by an [IBM PhD Fellowship](https://research.ibm.com/university/awards/fellowships-awardees.html) and a [Siebel Scholarship](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240920559594/en/Siebel-Scholars-Foundation-Announces-Class-of-2025). 

Originally, I come from the capital city of a small country in southeastern Europe - Prishtina, Kosovo. 

<i>I like mischief, adventures, and mornings.</i>
